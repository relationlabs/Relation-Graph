# Relation-Graph

## Introduction
`Relation Graph` is a substrate pallet that allows anyone to use GraphDB in [Substrate platform](https://substrate.io/).
`Relation Graph` provides organizations with ready-to-use GraphDB service for successfully running Dapps on the Substrate.  using `Relation Graph` Dapps builders can focus on bussiness logic by removing the complexities of Substrate.
1、one click deploy on substrate;
2、Mask complex all on-chain operations with sparql;
3、sparql as blockchain.

It supports the following specifications:
* [SPARQL 1.1 Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), [SPARQL 1.1 Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/), and [SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).
* [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/), [N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), and [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/).
* [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/) and [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results CSV and TSV Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/).

## Ecosystem Fit

- Relation graph can effectively reduces the development threshold of building Web3 decentralized applications which contains large data.
- It will bring a pallet of graph database to Polkadot ecosystem.

## Overview
### Documentation
