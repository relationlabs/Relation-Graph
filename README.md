# Relation Graph

## Introduction
`Relation Graph` derived from [Oxigraph 0.2.x](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/tree/v0.2.5) is a substrate pallet that allows anyone to use GraphDB in the [Substrate blockchain platform](https://substrate.io/).  
It provides ready-to-use GraphDB service and hides the complexities for Dapps on the Substrate platform, so Dapps builders can focus on their business logic.
- One click deploy on Substrate.  
- Hide the complexities of on-chain operations with SPARQL.

It supports the following specifications:
* [SPARQL 1.1 Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), [SPARQL 1.1 Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/), and [SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).
* [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/), [N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), and [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/).
* [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/) and [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results CSV and TSV Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/).

## Ecosystem Fit

- Relation graph can effectively reduces the development threshold of building Web3 decentralized applications which contains large data.
- It will bring a pallet of graph database to Polkadot ecosystem.
